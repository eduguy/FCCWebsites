# FCCWebsites
As part of completing the Responsive Web Design certification on FreeCodeCamp, I created 4 unique websites, plus my personal website. As I improved my HTML and CSS skills to make repsonsive websites, the websites in this repository also improve.

You can also see the code and see the websites in action on my CodePen collection here: https://codepen.io/collection/ANrddd
